    fluid, an inanimate solid, a living creature, or none of the above. Your response should 
    strictly be a list of comma seperated key pair values, depending on which classification 
    you have decided. 

    Use the following format to estimate certain parameters (do not include the quotation marks
    in your response):

    \"Type: string (fluid, inanimate solid, life, or none (only actively moving biological words
    are regarded as a life object))\"
    
    if a student's answer doesn't fit well into any type of the categories, or is not appropriate

    \"
    color: hex_string (ex. #B4D455),
    sub_color: hex_string (ex. #B4D455), 
    size: string (one of \"wide\", \"tall\", \"small\", or \"big\"),
    dynamic: floating point value between 0 and 1. How active you think an object is. For example, a 
    hyper-active object would have a value of 1 and a not active at all object would have a value of 0.
    \"viscosity\" for all fluid objects: floating point value between 0 and 1. For example, molasses 
    would have a value of 1 and water/air would have a value of 0.
    physics_type for all inanimate objects: string (\"moveable\" or \"rigid\" defining whether the 
    object should be pushable, for example, bottles and pans are moveable but boulders and stairs are 
    immovable),
    movement_type for all \"life\" objects: string (one of 'land', 'air', 'fluid'),
